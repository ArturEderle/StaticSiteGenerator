# Static Site Generator

This repository contains the implementation of a static site generator developed as part of a guided project in the Boot.dev Backend Developer Course. While the project followed a structured outline provided by the course, it was intentionally designed to encourage independent problem-solving rather than presenting fully prewritten solutions.

The organization and architecture of the codebase were not a primary concern, as the project’s objective was to reinforce core backend development skills rather than demonstrate production-level software design.

In a few areas—particularly within the testing suite—some code segments were adapted from the course solutions. This was due to uncertainty regarding what exactly should be tested and how. To address this, I plan to study additional resources on unit testing upon completing the course, with the goal of strengthening my testing proficiency.

### Reflection and Future Improvements

It is important to note that several code sections—especially those related to functionality implementation—were directly inspired by or derived from the provided solutions. This decision stemmed from challenges I faced in implementing certain components correctly, both in terms of logic and structure.

As such, I acknowledge that this project will need to be revisited in the future, once I have had the opportunity to digest the knowledge gained throughout the course and reflect on the mistakes and limitations of my current approach.

My primary difficulties during the development process included:

- Designing recursive functions that manage file operations effectively  
- Structuring test cases with appropriate scope and clarity  
- Understanding how to generalize behavior across varying content hierarchies  
- Managing path resolution in different runtime environments  

These challenges highlighted areas where I require deeper understanding and more deliberate practice. Repeating the project with a fresh perspective will be a valuable exercise in consolidating skills and improving software craftsmanship.
