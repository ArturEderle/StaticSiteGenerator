# Statis Site Generator

This repository contains the implementation of a static site generator developed as part of a guided project in the Boot.dev Backend Developer Course. While the project followed a structured outline provided by the course, it was intentionally designed to encourage independent problem-solving rather than presenting fully prewritten solutions.

The organization and architecture of the codebase were not a primary concern, as the project’s objective was to reinforce core backend development skills rather than demonstrate production-level software design.

In a few areas—particularly within the testing suite—some code segments were adapted from the course solutions. This was due to uncertainty regarding what exactly should be tested and how. To address this, I plan to study additional resources on unit testing upon completing the course, with the goal of strengthening my testing proficiency.
